    %dl
      %dt What's up with the name?
      %dd We use static site generators to prototype apps and sites quickly. Proteus was an early Greek sea god and was a shapeshifter. The English word "protean" means "able to do many things, change easily, versatile".

      %dt My favorite generator isn't listed!
      %dd We'll be adding more as we find ourselves using more of them. Can't wait? Put together a template that includes the tools listed above and we would love to add it to the list.
