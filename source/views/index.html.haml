    %p Then pick the project you want to start (i.e. Middleman)

    %pre
      %code proteus new middleman your-project-name

    %p We have also included some handy shortcuts for you to use in your Proteus kit: <code>proteus setup</code>, <code>proteus server</code> and <code>proteus deploy</code>

    %h2 Questions
    %dl
      %dt What's up with the name?
      %dd Proteus was an early Greek sea god and was a shapeshifter. The English word "protean" means "able to do many things, change easily, versatile". We use static site generators to prototype apps and sites quickly, so it seemed like a good fit.

      %dt My favorite generator isn't listed!
      %dd We'll be adding more as we find ourselves using more of them. Can't wait? Put together a template that includes the tools listed above and we would love to add it to the list.
